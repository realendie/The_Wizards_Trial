**Title: The Wizard's Trial**

---

**Introduction:**
You awaken in a dimly lit chamber, the air thick with the scent of old parchment and burning candles. A robed figure stands before you, their face obscured by a hood. "Welcome, apprentice," the figure intones. "Your trial begins now. Prove yourself worthy of the title of wizard, or be cast into the void."

---

**Prompt 1:**
The robed figure gestures to two doors. One glows faintly blue, the other red. "Choose your path," they say.

- **Option 1:** Enter the blue door.
- **Option 2:** Enter the red door.

---

**Blue Door Path:**
You step into the blue door and find yourself in a serene forest. The sound of birdsong fills the air, but a shadow looms overhead. A massive griffin lands before you, its eyes gleaming with intelligence. "Prove your worth," it growls.

**Prompt 2:**
The griffin demands a test of your courage.

- **Option 1:** Attempt to tame the griffin.
- **Option 2:** Offer the griffin an artifact of power.

---

**Red Door Path:**
You step into the red door and find yourself in a blazing cavern. A fire elemental swirls before you, its flames crackling with menace. "Only the strong may pass," it roars.

**Prompt 2:**
The elemental challenges you to prove your strength.

- **Option 1:** Use a water spell to extinguish the elemental.
- **Option 2:** Attempt to negotiate with the elemental.

---

**Final Stage:**
Both paths lead to a grand hall where the robed figure awaits. "You have done well," they say. "But one final test remains." A riddle appears on the wall: *"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"*

**Prompt 3:**
- **Option 1:** Answer "An echo."
- **Option 2:** Answer "A shadow."

---

**Ending:**
- **Correct Answer (An echo):** The robed figure nods. "You are worthy. Welcome, wizard." The chamber transforms into a grand library filled with magical tomes.
- **Incorrect Answer (A shadow):** The robed figure shakes their head. "You have failed." The chamber fades, and you find yourself back at the beginning of the trial.
